# Data-Mining-Project

In this project us the Universal Super Hospital Team are looking to investigate the factors of what could be leading to a patient being underweight, overweight or obese to better understand the patients health on a holistic level. We hope by building models we can predict what category a person would be based on their lifestyle choices. The models used for investigation are linear regression, logistic regression, random forest, gradient boosting, decision tree an K nearest neighbor. For exploratory analysis we used correlations, boxplots, scatter plots, and distrubtion's.
 
The data that we are using for this exploration is a collection of data collected by data scientists at UC Irvine for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from Mexico, Peru and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. There are sixteen features in the data and 2111 instances. Twenty-three percent of the data was collected directly through users on a web platform and seventy-seven percent was generated synthetically using a Weka tool. There are no missing values.
